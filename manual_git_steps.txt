Steps to Publish Your Repository to GitHub:

1. Set the remote correctly:
   ```
   git remote remove auv
   git remote add origin https://github.com/QU-RoboSub/auv.git
   ```

2. Create a .gitignore file to exclude build artifacts:
   ```
   # Python
   __pycache__/
   *.py[cod]
   *$py.class
   *.so
   .Python
   build/
   develop-eggs/
   dist/
   downloads/
   eggs/
   .eggs/
   lib/
   lib64/
   parts/
   sdist/
   var/
   wheels/
   *.egg-info/
   .installed.cfg
   *.egg

   # ROS specific
   install/
   log/
   build/

   # Recordings
   *.avi

   # System specific
   .DS_Store
   Thumbs.db
   ```

3. Add and commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add gitignore file"
   ```

4. Fetch from remote:
   ```
   git fetch origin
   ```

5. Pull with rebase (or merge):
   ```
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```
   If there are conflicts, resolve them and continue:
   ```
   git add <resolved-files>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

6. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

If you're prompted for credentials, you may need to:
- Enter your GitHub username and personal access token
- Or set up SSH keys for authentication

If you get a non-fast-forward error:
1. Try force pushing (only if you're sure you want to overwrite the remote):
   ```
   git push -f origin main
   ```
2. Or consider creating a new branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b new-main
   git push -u origin new-main
   ```
